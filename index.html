    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">There's various ways I would advice a potential client to secure his/hers website, but first of all I would explain that their web application should not trust any data from the web server.
        <br><br>I would also inform them a little bit about keeping user data sanitized before displayed, so they can make sure that the next person working on their server/application will make sure that this is taken care of.

        <p>If the client is for example a big enterprise/company, I would highly advice to run some bug bountys for their site.
        <br>Also I would strongly recommend scanning their website/server for vulnerabilitys, using dedicated vulnerability scanners, such as Nessus, Burp Suite, and Threatspy.
        </p>
        <p>I would also advice my customer to always stay up do date with whatever services they are running on their site. For example if they are using XAMPP/Apache server, they should always check for security updates and make sure they are up to date.
        </p>
        <p>I will inform and try to make sure their server and all services are using the https protocol, to keep their information encrypted.
        </p>
        <p>Last, but not least important is two-factor-authentication, it is a very good way of making sure that the information requested is sent to the real owner and making it real hard for an hacker to steal and hijack user sessions.
